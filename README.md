<h1>Overview</h1>

This program is implementation of my Levestein's 
algorithm modification. It is designed to compare
words and returns coefficient of similarity from
0 to 1. 0 means absolutely different words, 1
means equal words.

Modification allows considering some of letter
similarity, for instance words "mint" and "mind"
are more similar than words "mint" and "mink".
Works for english, russian and ukrainian.
